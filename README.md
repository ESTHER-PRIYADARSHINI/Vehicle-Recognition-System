# Vehicle-Recognition-System
In this project, we develop an image classification system which automatically identifies and categorizes vehicles from traffic cameras to curb the misuse of designated lanes.

This repository contains two files - 
1) A Jupyter Notebook consisting the code
2) A powerpoint presentation of the final product delivery
   
In the notebook, we are classifying different vehicle images.
To do this we first use a Convolutional Neural Networks model. In it, we tried to improve the accuracy of the classification.
We used MongoDB for storage of images and Spark for processing.
We are plotted the performance metrics with the matplotlib library of python.
