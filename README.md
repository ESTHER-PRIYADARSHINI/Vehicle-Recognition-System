# Vehicle-Recognition-System
In this project, we develop an image classification system which automatically identifies and categorizes vehicles from traffic cameras to curb the misuse of designated lanes.
In this notebook, we are classifying different vehicle images.
To do this we first use a Convolutional Neural Networks model. In this part we tried to improve the accuracy of the classification.
In the next section, we use the concepts taught in DATA 603 for classification. For example, we used MongoDB for storage of images and Spark for processing.
We are plotting the the performance metrics with the matplotlib library of python.
